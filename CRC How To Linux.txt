Openshift 4.3 cluster on your laptop or Desktop. 
Code Ready Containers CRC How to.     

Starting with an Openshift cluster on your laptop or desktop.
There are versions for Linuz, Mac-OS and Windows. 

Prereq: 
You will need a free Redhat.com account if you don’t already have one. 
Go to https://www.openshift.com/
Either login in or create an account.  This is required for the pull secret.

Linux Install 
Step 1: Install required software packages
CodeReady Containers requires the libvirt and NetworkManager packages to be installed on the host system prior to its setup.

------- Fedora ----------
sudo dnf install NetworkManager qemu-kvm libvirt virt-installg
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd

------ CentOS 7 ---------
sudo yum -y install qemu-kvm libvirt virt-install bridge-utils NetworkManager
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd 

------ Ubuntu ----------
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon libvirt-daemon-system network-managerh



Step 2: Install CodeReady Containers
Download the latest binary file for CRC from the below URL.
This is for windows or linix or Mac-os
https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/crc/latest/crc-linux-amd64.tar.xz
This is specific to linux
wget https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/crc/latest/crc-linux-amd64.tar.xz

Extract the downloaded CodeReady Containers archive.
tar xvf crc-linux-amd64.tar.xz
Place the binary in your $PATH .

cd crc*/
sudo cp crc /usr/local/bin
Confirm installation by checking the software version.

$ crc version
crc version: 1.7.0+fa7e558
OpenShift version: 4.3.1 (embedded in binary)

You will also need a Web Browser : There are several options here is 
How to install Google Chrome on Linux. 
Enable Google YUM Repository
1. vi /etc/yum.repos.d/google-chrome.repo
Populate with , 

[google-chrome]
name=google-chrome
baseurl=http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/rpm/stable/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub

Save the file, 

2. Install Google Chrome 
Find it,     # yum info google-chrome-stable
Install it,  # yum install google-chrome-stable
Update it, # # yum update google-chrome-stable
3. If you want to install this on a remote linux station and work remotely from a 
Windows Laptop you can install a X-viewer  like “Xming”

To view crc commands help page, run:
$ crc --help 
CodeReady Containers is a tool that manages a local OpenShift 4.x cluster optimized for testing and development purposes

Usage:
  crc [flags]
  crc [command]

Available Commands:
  config      Modify crc configuration
  console     Open the OpenShift Web Console in the default browser
  delete      Delete the OpenShift cluster
  help        Help about any command
  ip          Get IP address of the running OpenShift cluster
  oc-env      Add the 'oc' binary to PATH
  setup       Set up prerequisites for the OpenShift cluster
  start       Start the OpenShift cluster
  status      Display status of the OpenShift cluster
  stop        Stop the OpenShift cluster
  version     Print version information

Flags:
  -f, --force              Forcefully perform an action
  -h, --help               help for crc
      --log-level string   log level (e.g. "debug | info | warn | error") (default "info")

Step 3: Deploy CodeReady Containers virtual machine.

Run the crc setup command to set up your host operating system for the CodeReady Containers virtual machine.

$ crc setup

The installer will check for setup requirements before installation.

Step 4: Access OpenShift Cluster

You can access the OpenShift cluster deployed locally from CLI or by opening the OpenShift 4.x console on your web browser.

$ oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

Access as admin:

$ oc login -u kubeadmin -p  UMeRe-hBQAi-JJ4Bi-8ynRD https://api.crc.testing:6443
Login successful.
You have access to 51 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".

To open the console from your default web browser, run:

$ crc console

Login with the credentials printed earlier.

There you have a cluster running.
Step 5: Stopping OpenShift Cluster

To stop your OpenShift cluster, run the command:

$ crc stop
Stopping the OpenShift cluster, this may take a few minutes...
Stopped the OpenShift cluster

The virtual machine can be started any time by running the command:

$ crc start
